Jelly Labs consists of three departments:

- Research lab for blockchain technologies & software development
- Marketing
- Design

The team at Jelly Labs works cohesively across various departments to ensure efficient operation. However, in order to further enhance the capacity of each department, we plan to expand our workforce by hiring at least six additional full-time employees.

We are planning to grow our team in all three departments over the next 6-12 month. Especially our development department will be strengthened to be able to maintain and further develop jellyverse.

## Partnership with MVP Workshops

To build an even stronger team and further our development capabilities, we have partnered with MVP Workshop. They are a renowned blockchain and dApps development studio that has contributed to several leading projects on Polygon and other EVM blockchains. With this partnership, we aim to gradually expand Jelly Labs without compromising on manpower or experience.
