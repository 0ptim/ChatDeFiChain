# Notes

## Agent

The agent, which we are using, has a default prompt template configured. You can see this in [default_agent_prompt.md](./default_agent_prompt.md).

And a default tool-template configured, which you can see in [default_agent_tool.md](./default_agent_tool.md). It is a snaptshot from today _(22.01.2023)_ so it only contains the tools, which are currently configured.

To better align the agent with the DeFiChain project, we have configured a custom prompt template, which you can see in [custom_agent_prompt.md](./custom_agent_prompt.md).
