## Embeddings

This is a vector: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

An Embedding is just a vector, but with semantic meaning: `[X, Y]`

Position X = social power (max 1.0, min of -1.0)
Position Y = gender/sex (max 1.0, min of -1.0) 1.0 = ultra-masculine, -1.0 = ultra-feminine

`[1.0, 0.5]` = Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe
`[1.0, 1.0]` = Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe (If he was Dwayne Johnson)

`[-1.0, 0.0]` = Someone with no free will or agency, and also gender-neutral
